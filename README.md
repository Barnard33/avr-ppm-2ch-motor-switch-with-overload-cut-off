# avr-ppm-2ch-motor-switch-with-overload-cut-off
Drives two gear motors with 2 ppm channels and measures via a shunt if one or both of the motors are blocking. 
If so, both motors are switched off.
After moving the gimbals (or a three-way switch of your TX) to the neutral position, it is possible to start the motors again.

This is intended to drive gear motors without the need for an end-position-switch.
